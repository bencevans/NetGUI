{"name":"Netgui","tagline":"NetGUI is an official rewrite of what was originally known as WiFiz. NetGUI is a GUI frontend to NetCTL, a network manager developed for Arch Linux.","body":"# NetGUI\r\nNetGUI is a Graphical User Interface for [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/netctl](NetCTL). NetCTL \"is a CLI-based tool used to configure and manage network connections via profiles.\" NetGUI expands upon this by created a GUI interface. In short, NetGUI runs NetCTL commands to help make utilizing NetCTL a modern possibility, instead of what most people think of when they hear Linux.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nNetGUI is currently in beta, and has just recently come out of a development hiatus. NetGUI has several features, and they are:     Scanning for new networks via wpa\r\n*     GUI way to create new profiles (Under development)\r\n*     Connecting to any created profiles\r\n*     Automatic connection to created profiles (Under Development)\r\n*     Simple, intuitive interface for Gnome/GTK\r\n*     Simple editing of current profiles(Under Development)\r\n*     Automatically connect to open/unsecured networks (disabled on first run, enable through preferences) (WIP)\r\n*     Integration with Gnome Shell (an indicator in the top right bar of gnome, where volume etc... is, e.g. the panel) (Slightly, but badly, implemented)\r\n*     Notifications\r\n*     Open source under custom MIT license\r\n\r\n### What is TO-DO?\r\nAs with all software, NetGUI has to accomplish more items before I can consider it gold. These are:\r\n* add a tray icon (at least for GNOME 3)\r\n* interface with auto roaming\r\n* Some mild network diagnostics\r\n* Incorporate a launcher in the Activities menu.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@codywd (of course)\r\n@coquelicot \r\n@thebillywayne \r\n@183amir \r\n@GrayHatter\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
